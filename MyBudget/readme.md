This application uses **envelope budgeting**. The key indicators are:
1. **Budget Bucket** - represents named budget categories with expected amounts, which are the "envelopes"
2. **Period Bucket** - tracks actual amounts per period for each bucket, allowing you to allocate money into envelopes each pay period
3. **Account linkage** - buckets can be linked to specific accounts, enabling envelope-style allocation of funds

The application allocates money from accounts into named buckets/categories (envelopes) and tracks expected vs. actual amounts per period, which is the core concept of envelope budgeting.
